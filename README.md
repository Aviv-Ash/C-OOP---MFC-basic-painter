# C-OOP---MFC-basic-painter
This is a C++  MFC basic painter using OOP. 
This project is a painter application.
All the libraries was written by myself.
This project practiced me in such subjects as: Polymorphisem, inheritence, constructors, destructors(default and not default), serialization, and more.
The app allows you to draw diffarent shapes, delete all or some, change the drawn shape size, save, load and more.
